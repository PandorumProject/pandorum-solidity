Under Production... the amount of typos on this document is around to AWESOME

## Synopsis

Smart-contracts will allow us to make a total new way of organization and task-making from open-collaborative projects that are rewarded with ERC-20 Token (lets leave the Ether for Gas only). We have made a RegisterUser contract, Pandorum Protocol contract, Freelancing scrow contract and Token Emit contract.
We believe that with the right UX this will bring a new way of making income from apps on internet, so maybe we can reduce the pain produced by purposely failed economies.

This protocol will allow users to make straight collaborative projects from ideas, no need of extra knowledge, no need of extra action, just think and share.

Join us or start competing, anyways lets make this a better place.

## Pandorum Protocol Meta-Processes

This protocol is meant to have two kind of users, one is the high creativiy theoretical user which will be helpfull to direct the projects. The other will be the Maker, which will have the assigned tasks from each projects.
To really make a good benefit among users, this protocol has been thinked to just use one a project a time, so token emition can really be focused on getting things done, less dependence on userbase consistency.

For each Idea published in the Pandorum Blockchain, one smart-contract with all the requiered protocol will be made and it will be registered in the main contract of Pandorum Creative Network. 
Eventough an idea could miss the Idea Clash event, its still possible to ask for crowdfunding in order to make the project happen. 

### To Consider 

Altough this is a Beta Only Version, we believe this could be very usefull under some certain aspect of characteristics which will be mentioned below.

* Pandorum Token is the way of paying users for finishing tasks or making proposals in the theoretical level
* Merit Token is a way of accountability of impact, which are sent only in one direction after it gets burned for Pandorum Tokens.
* Ethereum Blockchain could make this system extremly expensive, thats why side-chains investigations are on-going, for an scalabe, low-cost network (Maybe bandwith one, Maybe Loom SDK)
* Code actually Only Works on Compiler V.0.4.23 

#### User Impact ELO

The Validation or the put of Merit Tokens in activities that end offering value to the community, will be recorded, so we can arrange an ranking of active users, and make mathematical models so users that make more immpact, get more rewarded, and users with low experience, makes less impact.
All this is designed in order to mitigate malicious peers making accounts just to pump the vote of a project, and magnifying the impact of users that show good behavior over time.  

#### Malicious User Mitigation

### Pandorum Brainstorm (Idea's Clatch)

Protocol opens the Polls for open-ideas proposals, every participant in RegisterUser contract with user.state = 1 (Registered) will be allowed to publish an idea. Those ideas will be published on the Pandorum Client, and users will vote and select which idea will be developed. This event is supossed to take from one to two weeks.

* Users have 5 Merit Votes to distribute every three days. The process of ideas selection will be done over a championiship-like process.

* "n" amount of ideas will be selected, in a pre-phase, then next round (n/2) and so on, untill two ideas clashes, and the network can decide with a 51% of approvation. The scope of "n" will be determined based on user amount.

* Ideas are mean to recieve 5% of the total token distribution assigned over time.

* If a project correctly passes the Brainstorm process, the creative theoretical users will be able to start defining the objetives of each projects via proposals, the protocol is meant to assign tasks to responsible peers by an active userbase consensys.

* For each Idea Vote users will have the possibility to do an impact feedback to the idea, and by other hand, start to defining the main project objetives in case, the idea passes to the next phase, the goal is that projects will be enough defined to start acting after it passes the "Final of Ideas"

* Allowing Crowdfunding could equal that some proyect dont need to be selected by the Poll Cycles
### Pandorum Tasks

When objetives are defined, freelancers or "makers" will be able to make proposals about how to solve each objetive, each task will have a determined amout of reward, based on the reserved amount of tokens held in the smart-contract of a winner idea.

## How to Deploy

### Requeriments

* Solidity Compiler, Remix IDE v. 0.4.23 - (Will be updated to actual compiler ASAP)
* Ether for smart-contract deploy (Ropsten Test-Network works well)
* EVM Interface as MetaMask or MyEtherWallet
* Yet still some imagination

### Contracts in Order

For the system working on his entire design, we have to deploy each contract in order

#### Pandorum Token Contract

The Pandorum Token cotract will handle, 1000 projects over the existence of this emition, each project will have a predetermined reward that will decrease overtime. The reason for this, is to make the fact that the best moment of taking action is the present moment, making the first projects the best one to get the biggest rewards.
