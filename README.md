## Synopsis

Smart-contracts will allow us to make a total new way of organization and task-making from open-collaborative projects. We have made a RegisterUser contract, Pandorum Protocol contract, Freelancing scrow contract and Token Emit contract.
We believe that in the right User-Experience this will bring a new way of making income from apps on internet, so maybe we can reduce the pain produced by purposely failed economies.

This protocol will allow users to make straight collaborative projects from ideas, no need of knowledge, no need of extra action, just think and share.

Join us or start competing, anyways lets make this a better place.

## Pandorum Protocol Meta-Processes

This protocol is meant to have two kind of users, one is the high creativiy theoretical user which will be helpfull to direct the projects. The other will be the Maker, which will have the assigned tasks from each projects.
To really make a good benefit among users, this protocol has been thinked to just use one a project a time, so token emition can really be focused on getting things done, less dependence on userbase consistency.

### Pandorum Brainstorm

Protocol opens the Polls for open-ideas proposals, every participant in RegisterUser contract with user.state = 1 (Registered) will be allowed to publish an idea. Those ideas will be published on the Pandorum Client, and users will vote and select which idea will be developed. This event is supossed to take from one to two weeks.

Users have 5 Merit Votes to distribute every three days. The process of ideas selection will be done over a championiship-like process.

 "n" amount of ideas will be selected, in a pre-phase, then next round (n/2) and so on, untill two ideas clashes, and the network can decide with a 51% of approvation. The scope of "n" will be determined based on user amount.

Ideas are mean to recieve 5% of the total token distribution assigned over time.

If a project correctly passes the Brainstorm process, the creative theoretical users will be able to start defining the objetives of each projects via proposals, the protocol is meant to assign tasks to responsible peers by an active userbase consensys.
